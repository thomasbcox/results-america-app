# 📊 CSV Formats That Work with Existing Code

## ✅ **SUPPORTED CSV FORMATS**

The existing code supports **two main CSV formats** that can be successfully loaded:

---

## 🎯 **FORMAT 1: Multi-Category Data Import**

**Template:** `Multi-Category Data Import`  
**Headers:** `State, Year, Category, Measure, Value`

### **✅ Working Example:**
```csv
State,Year,Category,Measure,Value
California,2023,Economy,Median Household Income,85000
Texas,2023,Economy,Median Household Income,72000
California,2023,Education,High School Graduation Rate,85.2
Texas,2023,Education,High School Graduation Rate,89.1
Alabama,2023,Healthcare,Life Expectancy,75.2
Alaska,2023,Healthcare,Life Expectancy,78.9
```

### **📋 Requirements:**
- **States:** Must match seeded states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia)
- **Categories:** Must match seeded categories (Education, Healthcare, Economy, Environment, Infrastructure)
- **Measures:** Must match seeded statistics within their categories:
  - **Education:** "High School Graduation Rate", "College Enrollment Rate"
  - **Healthcare:** "Life Expectancy", "Infant Mortality Rate"
  - **Economy:** "Unemployment Rate", "Median Household Income"

---

## 🎯 **FORMAT 2: Single-Category Data Import**

**Template:** `Single-Category Data Import`  
**Headers:** `State, Year, Value`

### **✅ Working Example:**
```csv
State,Year,Value
California,2023,85000
Texas,2023,72000
Alabama,2023,65000
Alaska,2023,78000
Arizona,2023,68000
```

### **📋 Requirements:**
- **States:** Must match seeded states
- **Category & Measure:** Must be specified in metadata during upload
- **Value:** Must be numeric

## 🔧 **HOW TO TEST SUCCESSFUL LOADING**

### **Step 1: Create Test CSV Files**

**Multi-Category Example (`multi-category-test.csv`):**
```csv
State,Year,Category,Measure,Value
California,2023,Economy,Median Household Income,85000
Texas,2023,Economy,Median Household Income,72000
California,2023,Education,High School Graduation Rate,85.2
Texas,2023,Education,High School Graduation Rate,89.1
```

**Single-Category Example (`single-category-test.csv`):**
```csv
State,Year,Value
California,2023,85000
Texas,2023,72000
Alabama,2023,65000
```

### **Step 2: Test with Simple CSV Import Service**

```javascript
// Test Multi-Category Import
const multiCategoryFile = new File(multiCategoryCSV, 'multi-category-test.csv');
const result1 = await SimpleCSVImportService.uploadCSV(
  multiCategoryFile, 
  1, // Multi-Category template ID
  { description: 'Test multi-category import' },
  1 // user ID
);

// Test Single-Category Import
const singleCategoryFile = new File(singleCategoryCSV, 'single-category-test.csv');
const result2 = await SimpleCSVImportService.uploadCSV(
  singleCategoryFile,
  2, // Single-Category template ID
  { 
    description: 'Test single-category import',
    categoryName: 'Economy',
    statisticName: 'Median Household Income'
  },
  1 // user ID
);
```

## ⚠️ **COMMON FAILURE REASONS**

### **❌ State Name Mismatches**
```csv
# ❌ FAILS - "Calif" not found
State,Year,Category,Measure,Value
Calif,2023,Economy,Median Household Income,85000

# ✅ WORKS - "California" matches seeded data
State,Year,Category,Measure,Value
California,2023,Economy,Median Household Income,85000
```

### **❌ Category/Measure Mismatches**
```csv
# ❌ FAILS - "GDP" not in seeded statistics
State,Year,Category,Measure,Value
California,2023,Economy,GDP,3500000

# ✅ WORKS - "Median Household Income" exists in Economy category
State,Year,Category,Measure,Value
California,2023,Economy,Median Household Income,85000
```

### **❌ Invalid Data Types**
```csv
# ❌ FAILS - "N/A" is not numeric
State,Year,Category,Measure,Value
California,2023,Economy,Median Household Income,N/A

# ✅ WORKS - Numeric value
State,Year,Category,Measure,Value
California,2023,Economy,Median Household Income,85000
```

Alabama,2023,Education,High School Graduation Rate,82.1
Alaska,2023,Education,High School Graduation Rate,88.5
Arizona,2023,Education,High School Graduation Rate,84.7
```

### **Example 2: Healthcare Data**

## 📊 **SUMMARY**

**✅ SUCCESSFUL FORMATS:**
1. **Multi-Category:** `State,Year,Category,Measure,Value`
2. **Single-Category:** `State,Year,Value` (with metadata)

**✅ WORKING DATA:**
- **States:** Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia
- **Categories:** Education, Healthcare, Economy, Environment, Infrastructure
- **Measures:** High School Graduation Rate, College Enrollment Rate, Life Expectancy, Infant Mortality Rate, Unemployment Rate, Median Household Income

**✅ VALIDATION:**
- State names must match exactly (case-insensitive)
- Categories and measures must exist in seeded data
- Values must be numeric
- Years should be reasonable (e.g., 2020-2024)

The existing code **can successfully load** CSV files that follow these formats and use the seeded reference data!
